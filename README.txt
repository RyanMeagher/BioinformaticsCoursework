This is the code we used to generate all the data 

KLExpand - KLExpand function used for feature selection and dimentionality reduction
ANN - Code for ANN, different numbers of layers and nodes (see comments)
KNN_1set_LOO - KNN with the first set of variables (8 vars) using the leave one out method
KNN_second_set - KNN with second set of variables (5 vars) using leave one out method
testingtrainingdata.m - method used to divide data to testing and training data for the non leave one out code
KNN_no_LOO - same as above but using training and testing data shuffling and averaging accuracies
variable selection - apply thresholds to select variables
+ Hemo data set
